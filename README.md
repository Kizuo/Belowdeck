Don't stop at the settings menu, go Belowdeck and change what you want. After all, it's your system.

## Installation

<ol>
	<li>Find what OS your computer is using. <br>
	  <ul>
		  <li>Press the key next to (or close to) your space bar with four blocky, diagonal boxes on it on your computer's keyboard. If it opens up a Start Menu with apps in colorful boxes, that means you have Microsoft Windows. Continue onto the next step. <br>
		  <li> If that above step did not do anything, look at the top of your screen. If you see a narrow bar with an apple in the top left corner of your screen, you have macOS. Continue onto the next step. <br>
		  <li> If both of those things didn't apply to your machine, you probably have Linux. Good for you! Try the above steps to make sure you have the correct OS. Continue onto the next step. 
	</ul> <br>
	<li> To install the software, follow the steps below. <br>
		<ul>
			<li>If you have Microsoft Windows: 
			<ul>
			<li>Press the Windows key (the one with four diagonal boxes) and R at the same time. When Run opens,  take your hands off the keyboard if you haven't already and clear out anything in the box. Type in `cmd.exe` and press Ctrl, Shift, and Enter keys at the same time. Take your hands off the keyboard when the screen dims and Windows asks if you would like to allow Command Processor to make changes (or something like that). Click yes. You can breathe now. 
			<li>Once Command Prompt opens, <strong>minimize</strong> Command Prompt. Do not close it. If you do close it, follow the instructions above again.
